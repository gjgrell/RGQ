# RGQ
We model the effect of increased lithium-like presence on the line ratios R = z/(x + y), G = (x+y+z)/w, and Q = (q+r)/w for astrophysically important ions in a photoionized plasma, by solving the steady-state rate equations as a function of Li-like column density

## 1. Download
Download the latest source packages from
[here](https://github.com/gjgrell/RGQ),
gunzip, and extract it.

## 2. Usage
The input parameters for the ratio calculations are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Z - atomic number
    \item $N_{Li}$ - lithium-like column density (cm$^{-2}$)
    \item $N_{He}$ - helium-like column density (cm$^{-2}$)
    \item v - turbulent velocity (cm s$^{-1}$)
    \item $\phi_{UV}$ - UV photoexcitation rate (s$^{-1}$)
    \item $n_{e} - electron density (cm$^{-3}$)
    \item mixing
\end{enumerate}
